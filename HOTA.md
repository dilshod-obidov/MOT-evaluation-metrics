# Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA)

HOTA is a relatively new metric designed to evaluate the performance of multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. It addresses some limitations of existing metrics like MOTA and IDF1 by providing a more holistic and balanced evaluation of tracking performance.

## Key Components of HOTA

HOTA combines aspects of both detection and association accuracy into a single metric. It achieves this by calculating a geometric mean of these two components, which ensures that both aspects are equally important in the final score.

1. **Detection Accuracy (DetA):** Measures how accurately the tracking algorithm detects objects in the scene.
2. **Association Accuracy (AssA):** Measures how accurately the tracking algorithm maintains the identities of the detected objects over time.

## Calculating DetA and AssA

### Detection Accuracy (DetA)

Detection Accuracy (DetA) evaluates how well the tracking algorithm detects objects in the scene. It is essentially the Jaccard index (or Intersection over Union, IoU) averaged over all localization thresholds.

#### Steps to Calculate DetA:

1. **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Calculate the IoU for each detected object and its corresponding ground truth object.
   
   IoU = (Area of Overlap) / (Area of Union)

2. **Thresholding:** Apply multiple IoU thresholds (e.g., 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, etc.) to determine if a detection is considered a true positive.

3. **Average Jaccard Index:** For each threshold, compute the Jaccard index, which is the average IoU of true positives.
   
4. **Final DetA Score:** Average the Jaccard indices across all thresholds to get the final DetA score.

### Association Accuracy (AssA)

Association Accuracy (AssA) measures how well the tracking algorithm maintains the identities of detected objects over time. It is the Jaccard index for associations, averaged over all matching detections and localization thresholds.

#### Steps to Calculate AssA:

1. **Correct Associations:** For each detected object, determine if it maintains the correct identity over time compared to the ground truth.

2. **Association IoU:** Calculate the IoU for associations, which considers the overlap of correctly identified tracks.
   
   Association IoU = (Number of Correct Associations) / (Total Number of Associations)

3. **Thresholding:** Apply multiple association thresholds to determine if an association is considered correct.

4. **Average Jaccard Index for Associations:** For each threshold, compute the Jaccard index for associations.

5. **Final AssA Score:** Average the Jaccard indices for associations across all thresholds to get the final AssA score.

## Complete HOTA Calculation

Once you have the DetA and AssA scores, the HOTA score can be calculated using the geometric mean of these two components:

HOTA = sqrt(DetA * AssA)

## Interpretation of HOTA

- **Range:** HOTA ranges from 0 to 1.
  - A HOTA score of 1 indicates perfect tracking performance, with perfect detection and identity maintenance.
  - A score closer to 0 indicates poor performance, with significant errors in detection or identity maintenance or both.

- **Higher Values:** Higher HOTA values indicate better tracking performance, as they signify fewer errors in both detecting objects and maintaining their identities over time.

## Advantages and Limitations of HOTA

### Advantages

- **Balanced Metric:** By taking the geometric mean of detection and association accuracy, HOTA ensures that both aspects are equally weighted, providing a balanced evaluation of tracking performance.
- **Holistic Evaluation:** HOTA captures both detection and association errors, giving a more comprehensive measure of tracking performance compared to metrics that focus on only one aspect.
- **Sensitivity to Thresholds:** HOTA averages performance over various localization thresholds, making it robust to variations in detection thresholds.

### Limitations

- **Complexity:** The calculation of HOTA is more complex than simpler metrics like MOTA or IDF1, which might make it harder to interpret or implement without proper understanding.
- **Interpretation:** While HOTA provides a balanced view, the geometric mean can sometimes mask poor performance in one aspect if the other aspect is exceptionally good.

## Conclusion

HOTA is a valuable metric for evaluating multi-object tracking systems, offering a comprehensive measure of performance by considering both detection and association accuracy. It addresses the limitations of traditional metrics by providing a balanced and holistic evaluation, making it an essential tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of tracking algorithms.
